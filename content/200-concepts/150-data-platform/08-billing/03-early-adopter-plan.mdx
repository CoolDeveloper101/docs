If you started using the Prisma Data Platform before its [General Availability](/about/prisma/platform-releases#maturity-levels) on June&nbsp;15th,&nbsp;2022, any Prisma projects that you created or added run on the **Early Adopter** plan.

<Admonition type="warning">

**Early adopter vs. Early access**<br /><br />

- **Early Adopter** refers to the plan assigned to all projects created before the General Availability of the platform.<br /><br />
- **Early Access** refers to the [maturity level](/about/prisma/platform-releases) of the Prisma Data Platform which is the stage before General Availability.

## About the <strong>Early Adopter</strong> plan

The **Early Adopter** plan allows you to freely develop your Prisma projects on the Prisma Data Platform and use up to 100,000 CPU seconds of Data Proxy usage per project on the plan.

- Quota of 10 team members
- Quota of 7 environments
- Quota of 100,000 CPU seconds of Data Proxy usage per project
- Low concurrency (3 query engines to process your app queries)
- Supported team member roles
  - Admin
  - Collaborator
  - Developer
  - Viewer

Each quota on the **Early Adopter** is a _hard limit_. For example, if your projects exceeds the monthly quota of 100,000 CPU seconds during the month, you cannot continue using the Prisma Data Proxy and we will pause your project until the end of the month.

To avoid unexpected pauses on your project, you can [upgrade your project](/concepts/data-platform/billing/upgrading-plans) to the [Scale](/concepts/data-platform/billing/plans-and-quotas#strongscalestrong-plan) or [Enterprise](/concepts/data-platform/billing/plans-and-quotas#strongenterprisestrong-plan) plan.
