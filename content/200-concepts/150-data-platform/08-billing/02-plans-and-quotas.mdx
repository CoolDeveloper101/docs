The Prisma Data Platform provides a set of monthly plans that include quotas for:

- number of collaborators per project
- number of environments per project
- Prisma Data Proxy usage (in CPU milliseconds) per project

</TopBlock>

## About plans and quotas

Plans in the Prisma Data Platform are designed with the goal to help you scale your projects as the need for team members, environments, and Data Proxy usage grows.

Because of this, a single Prisma Data Platform plan applies for a single project.

We want to give you the option to create projects freely and you can then decide which project you want to upgrade to a paid plan. You can have many Prisma projects and you can upgrade only several of them to a paid plan.

<Admonition>

**Account-wide plans**<br /><br />
The notion of an account-wide plan that includes a certain number of projects or provides access to specific features does not exist in the Prisma Data Platform.<br />

</Admonition>

## The first plan of each project

- If a project is created or added in the Prisma Data Platform before the [General Availability](/about/prisma/platform-releases#maturity-levels) of the platform, it starts on the **Early Adopter** plan.
- If project is created after General Availability, it starts on the **Free** plan.

## Quotas

### Quotas for team members and environments

- You can add as many team members and environments as needed to a project.
- We bill for each additional team member and environment that exceeds the quota at a fixed price based on the plan.
- When you add a team member or environment that exceeds your quota, we bill you with a pro-rated charge until the end of the current month with the next month's invoice.
- After that, we bill you monthly at the fixed price per collaborator or environment for your plan.
- If at any point during the current month you remove any previously added collaborators or environments from the monthly quota, we issue a prorated refund for the unused time until the end of the month.

### Quotas for the Prisma Data Proxy

- Each plan includes different Data Proxy CPU usage quotas which reset at the beginning of every month.
- The **Early Adopter** and **Free** plans have a hard limit of monthly Data Proxy CPU usage.
- If a project reaches the hard limit on **Early Adopter** and **Free** plans, we will send you a notification in advance and you can consider upgrading to a paid plan.
- If a project reaches the hard limit on **Early Adopter** and **Free** plans and you decide to not upgrade to a paid plan, we will pause your project until the beginning of next month when the Data Proxy CPU usage quota resets.
- On the **Scale** and **Enterprise** plans, the Data Proxy usage quota is unlimited. We do bill for any additional Data Proxy CPU ms that exceed the monthly quota in your project plan.
- We do not issue refunds for unused Data Proxy CPU usage quotas.
