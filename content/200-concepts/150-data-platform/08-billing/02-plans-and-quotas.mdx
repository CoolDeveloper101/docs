The Prisma Data Platform provides a set of monthly plans that include quotas for:

- number of collaborators per project
- number of environments per project
- Prisma Data Proxy usage (in CPU seconds) per project

</TopBlock>

## About plans and quotas

Plans in the Prisma Data Platform are designed with the goal to help you scale your projects as the need for team members, environments, and Data Proxy usage grows.

Because of this, a single Prisma Data Platform plan applies for a single project.

We want to give you the option to create projects freely and you can then decide which project you want to upgrade to a paid plan. You can have many Prisma projects and you can decide to upgrade only several of them to a paid plan.

<Admonition>

**Account-wide plans**<br /><br />
The notion of an account-wide plan that includes a certain number of projects or provides access to specific features does not exist in the Prisma Data Platform.<br />

</Admonition>

## The first plan of each project

All projects created or added to the Prisma Data Platform start on the [**Free**](/concepts/data-platform/billing/plans-and-quotas#strongfreestrong-plan) plan.

<Admonition>

**Note**<br /><br />
If you created a project before June 15th, 2022, your project is on the [**Early Adopter**](/concepts/data-platform/billing/early-adopter-plan) plan.

## Quotas

### Quotas for team members and environments

- You can add as many team members and environments as needed to a project.
- We bill for each additional team member and environment that exceeds the quota at a fixed price based on the plan.
- When you add a team member or environment that exceeds the quota, we first bill you with a pro-rated amount until the end of the current month. This is included in the invoice for next month.
- After that, we bill you monthly at the fixed price per collaborator or environment for your plan.
- If at any point during the current month you remove any previously added collaborators or environments from the monthly quota, we issue a refund for any unused time in the invoice for the next month.

### Quotas for the Prisma Data Proxy

- Each plan includes different Data Proxy CPU usage quotas which reset at the beginning of every month.
- The **Early Adopter** and **Free** plans have a hard limit of monthly Data Proxy CPU usage.
- If a project reaches the hard limit on **Early Adopter** and **Free** plans, we will pause your project until the beginning of next month when the Data Proxy CPU usage quota resets.
- We will send notifications in advance before your project reaches the hard limit, so that you have time to consider upgrading to a paid plan to avoid service interruptions.
- On the **Scale** and **Enterprise** plans, the Data Proxy usage quota is unlimited (no hard limits). Both plans include an initial quota of Data Proxy usage and additional usage exceeding the quota is billed on a monthly basis.
- We do not issue refunds for unused Data Proxy CPU usage quotas.
