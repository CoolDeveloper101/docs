The Prisma Data Platform provides a set of monthly plans that include quotas for the number of collaborators and environments per project, as well as a quota for the usage of the Prisma Data Proxy (in CPU miliseconds).

## About plans and quotas

The important thing to understand about plans in the Prisma Data Platform is that a single plan is attached to a single project. The notion of an account-wide plan that includes a certain number of projects or provides access to specific features does not exist.

You can create an unlimited number of projects in the Prisma Data Platform and you can decide which of these you want to upgrade to a paid plan. For example, you can have 100 Prisma projects and you can purchase a paid plan for only 2 of those.

Because a plan is assigned to a single project, each plan defines certain quotas that apply for that project.

Any project that you create or add in the Prisma Data Platform runs on the `Early Adopter` plan if it was created or added before the General Availability of the platform. Projects that you add or create after General Availability run on the `Free` plan.

The PA plan applies for a single project only and when you decide to upgrade your project to a paid plan, such as `Scale` or `Enterprise`, you do so for that single project.

\*_**QEIDs**_ refers to the number of available query engines that the Prisma Data Proxy can start and keep alive to manage the connection pool to the database for a project.

**Billing**

- You can select a different plan for each of your projects.
- For each project on a paid plan, we bill monthly and issue a separate invoice per project.
- You can request yearly billing by contacting Sales.

**Quotas for collaborators and environments**

- You can add collaborators and environments to a project only within the quota in your plan.
- On paid plans, you can increase the quota by adding more collaborators and environments.
- When you add a collaborator or environment to your quota, we bill you with a pro-rated charge until the end of the current month. After that, we bill you monthly at the fixed price per collaborator or environment for your plan.
- If at any point during the current month you remove any previously added collaborators or environments from the monthly quota, we issue a prorated refund for the unused time until the end of the month.

**Quotas for the Prisma Data Proxy**

- The plans include different Data Proxy CPU usage quotas which reset at the beginning of every month.
- The `Early Adopter` and `Free` plans have a hard limit of monthly Data Proxy CPU usage.
- If you reach the hard limit on `Early Adopter` and `Free` plans, you can consider upgrading to a paid plan.
- On the `Scale` and `Enterprise` plans, the Data Proxy usage quota is technically unlimited. We do bill for any additional Data Proxy CPU ms that exceed the monthly quota.
