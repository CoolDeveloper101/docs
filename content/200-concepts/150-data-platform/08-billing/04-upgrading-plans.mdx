The Prisma Data Platform provides a set of monthly plans that include quotas for the number of collaborators and environments per project, as well as a quota for the usage of the Prisma Data Proxy (in CPU miliseconds).

## Plans

Plans in the Prisma Data Platform apply for a single project. Each project is billed monthly (on the 1st) by default. You can request yearly billing by contacting Sales.

\*The term _**QEIDs**_ refers to the query engines that the Prisma Data Proxy starts and maintains to optimize and manage the connection pool to the database.

**Billing**

- You can select a different plan for each of your projects.
- For each project on a paid plan, we bill monthly and issue a separate invoice per project.
- You can request yearly billing by contacting Sales.

**Quotas for collaborators and environments**

- You can add collaborators and environments to a project only within the quota in your plan.
- On paid plans, you can increase the quota by adding more collaborators and environments.
- When you add a collaborator or environment to your quota, we bill you with a pro-rated charge until the end of the current month. After that, we bill you monthly at the fixed price per collaborator or environment for your plan.
- If at any point during the current month you remove any previously added collaborators or environments from the monthly quota, we issue a prorated refund for the unused time until the end of the month.

**Quotas for the Prisma Data Proxy**

- The plans include different Data Proxy CPU usage quotas which reset at the beginning of every month.
- The `Early Adopter` and `Free` plans have a hard limit of monthly Data Proxy CPU usage.
- If you reach the hard limit on `Early Adopter` and `Free` plans, you can consider upgrading to a paid plan.
- On the `Scale` and `Enterprise` plans, the Data Proxy usage quota is technically unlimited. We do bill for any additional Data Proxy CPU ms that exceed the monthly quota.

## About the **Early Adopter** plan

If you started using the Prisma Data Platform before the announcement of its General Availability on Jun 16, 2022, any Prisma projects that you created or added run on the `Early Adopter` plan.

<Admonition type="warning">

`Early Adopter` refers to the plan assigned to all projects created before the Prisma Data Platform General Availability.<br /><br />

`Early Access` refers to the [maturity level](/about/prisma/platform-releases) of the Prisma Data Platform.

</Admonition>

- The `Early Adopter` plan allows up to 300,000 CPU ms of Data Proxy usage per project.
- Projects on an `Early Adopter` plan can use up to 3 query engines to process your app queries.
- As your project makes use of the Data Proxy usage quota, you will receive notifications on the email address associated with your GitHub account when the quota use reaches 50%, 75%, 90%, and 100%.

[Check out](/concepts/data-platform/projects/upgrading-plans#plans) how the `Early Adopter` plan compares to the `Scale` and `Enterprise` plans in the table above.

## Upgrade to Scale plan

If you have a Prisma project which is currently on an `Early Adopter` or `Free` plan, and you want to increase the quota of environments, collaborators, or the Prisma Data Proxy CPU usage, you can do so by upgrading to the `Scale` plan.

**Considerations and prerequisites**

Only project owners (creators) can upgrade a project to a paid plan.

**Steps**

1. Go to the [**Billing**](https://cloud.prisma.io/billing) page.
2. Click **Upgrade** for the project you want to upgrade.
3. Select the **Scale** plan and click **Review Details**.
4. Click **Pay Now and Upgrade**.

**Result**

Your project is now upgraded to the Scale plan.

## Upgrade to Enterprise plan

Enterprise plans are custom-made and allow teams of any size to establish the number of environments and collaborators needed for their Prisma projects, as well as benefit from a custom amount of Prisma Data Proxy CPU usage that makes the most sense for a project.

**Considerations and prerequisites**

Only project owners (creators) can upgrade a project to a paid plan.

**Steps**

1. Go to the [**Billing**](https://cloud.prisma.io/billing) page.
2. Click **Upgrade** for a project you want to upgrade.
3. Select the **Enterprise** plan and click **Contact Sales**.
