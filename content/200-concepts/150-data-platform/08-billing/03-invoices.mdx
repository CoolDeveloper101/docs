## About invoices and billing

- Billing is a done on a monthly basis
- You are billed and receive invoices each month on the 1st
- You receive a separate invoice for each project plan
- The first invoice is a pro-rated charge of the monthly plan price based on the date on which you purchased

## Invoice from initial plan purchase

When you purchase the [`Scale` plan](/concepts/data-platform/billing/plans-and-quotas#scale-plan) for the first time, you will receive an invoice that is a pro-rated amount for the remainder of the month based on the purchase date.
