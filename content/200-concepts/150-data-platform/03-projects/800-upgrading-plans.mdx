<TopBlock>

Each project you create in the Prisma Data Platform starts by running on a free plan (`Early Adopter` or `Free`).

You can upgrade your project to a paid plan to increase the Prisma Data Proxy usage and the number of team members and environments that you can add to your project.

**Available plans**<br /><br />
See [Plans and quotas](/concepts/data-platform/billing/plans-and-quotas) for a list and descriptions of all plans available in the Prisma Data Platform.

Projects created before Jun 16, 2022 run on the `Early Adopter` plan and those created after that run on the `Free` plan.

## Considerations and prerequisites

Only project owners (creators) can upgrade a project to a paid plan.

## Upgrade to <inlinecode>Scale</inlinecode> plan

If you have a Prisma project which is currently on an `Early Adopter` or `Free` plan, and you want to increase the quota of environments, collaborators, and the Prisma Data Proxy CPU usage, you can do so by upgrading to the `Scale` plan.

**Steps**

1. Go to the [**Billing**](https://cloud.prisma.io/billing) page.
2. Click **Upgrade** for the project you want to upgrade.
3. Select the **Scale** plan and click **Review Details**.
4. Click **Pay Now and Upgrade**.

**Result**

Your project is now upgraded to the Scale plan.

## Upgrade to <inlinecode>Enterprise</inlinecode> plan

An `Enterprise` plan can be custom-made and allows teams of all sizes to establish the number of environments and collaborators needed, as well as benefit from a custom amount of Prisma Data Proxy CPU usage that makes the most sense for a Prisma project.

**Steps**

1. Go to the [**Billing**](https://cloud.prisma.io/billing) page.
2. Click **Upgrade** for a project you want to upgrade.
3. Select the **Enterprise** plan and click **Contact Sales**.

**Result**
