In this page, you can find information about the limits that the Prisma Data Platform and the Prisma Data Proxy have in place.

You can also learn about the compatibility of the platform with the Prisma ORM and the availability and SLOs that the platform provides.

## Concurrency limits of the Prisma Data Proxy

The concurrency limits of the Prisma Data Proxy define the maximum number of proxy instances that can run simultaneously for a single project. By default, only one proxy instance is started for a single project environment.

More proxy instances start when:

- you create and start using a new environment
- the number of running proxy instances cannot handle the number of incoming queries
- multiple Prisma Clients connect that use a different version of the Prisma Client
- multiple Prisma Clients connect that use a different version of the Prisma Schema

| Concurrency limits                                                     | Number |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Maximum number of concurrent proxy instances on **Early Adopter** plan | 3      |
| Maximum number of concurrent proxy instances on **Free** plan          | 100    |
| Maximum number of concurrent proxy instances on **Scale** plan         | 100    |
| Maximum number of concurrent proxy instances on **Enterprise** plan    | Custom |

A single proxy instance can handle ~1200 RPS which translates to ~69 concurrent database connections.

<Admonition>

**Extending the concurrency limits**<br /><br />
If you have a project running on the **Scale** plan and the project exceeds 6900 concurrent database connections, contact Support and let us know about your project requirements.

## Compatibility with Prisma ORM

We are dedicated to keeping the Prisma Data Platform compatible with the latest version of the Prisma ORM.

- **Compatibility of Data Browser, Query Console, Schema with the Prisma ORM**
  - The interfaces are updated after each Prisma ORM release and aim to support the latest version.
  - In rare occasions, there might be several days worth of a delay before the interfaces begin to support the latest version of the Prisma ORM.
- **Compatibility of the Prisma Data Proxy with the Prisma ORM**
  - Prisma Data Proxy is updated almost immediately to the latest version of the Prisma ORM.
  - Prisma Data Proxy does not support the preview features `interactiveTransactions` and `metrics`.

## Availability and SLOs

You can view the current status of the Prisma Data Platform by clicking **Status** in the upper-right. The [Prisma Status](https://www.prisma-status.com/) page opens and includes:

- current status of the platform
- current and historical uptime of the Prisma Data Proxy in all supported locations
- current and historical uptime of the Platform Control Plane (Web interface and API)
- log of past incidents

The SLO (service-level objective) of the Prisma Data Platform is to provide 99.95% availability which is equal to the total of 20 minutes of downtime during a single month.
