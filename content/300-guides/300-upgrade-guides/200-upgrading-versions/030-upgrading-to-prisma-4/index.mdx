## Upgrading the <inlinecode>prisma</inlinecode> and <inlinecode>@prisma/client</inlinecode> packages to Prisma 4

To upgrade to Prisma 4 from a `3.x.x` version, you need to update both the `prisma` and `@prisma/client` packages. Both the `prisma` and `@prisma/client` packages install with a caret `^` in their version number. This allows upgrades to new minor versions, but not major versions, to safeguard against breaking changes.

To ignore the caret `^` and upgrade across major versions, you can use the `@4` tag when upgrading with `npm`, or `yarn`:
